            Function Modeling is a new 
            raster processing methodology used to create and store 
            transformations of raster datasets. Function Modeling uses function datasets
            <a href="http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisdesktop/10.0/help/index.html#/Rasters_with_functions/009t0000000m000000/">ESRI website</a> 
            and our open source .net code library to store all the functions occurring to a 
            source raster and dynamically build those datasets at run time. Function 
            modeling significantly improves raster processing a substantially reduces 
            storage associated with raster modeling. Benefits of Function Modeling include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>no intermediate raster dataset creation </li>
            <li>immediate depiction of raster transformations</li>
            <li>faster processing</li>
            <li>reduced storage</li>
            <li>increased efficiency </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The figure above illustrates the conceptual idea behind function modeling. For 
            each raster transformation, conventional modeling creates an intermediate output 
            raster dataset. Function modeling however remove this step thereby reducing 
            processing time and storage space. Moreover, Function Modeling gives analysts 
            the option to save models so they can be loaded into ArcMap at a later date.</p>
